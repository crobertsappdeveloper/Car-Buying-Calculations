# Car-Buying-Calculations
User enters values for two cars based on mileage, miles per gallon, etc. and an algorithm compares which car is the best value then displays the result along with the value of each car.

This app demonstrates the use of multiple numeric text views to create an algorithm for two calculations for comparison purposes. Also toasts are used to inform the user if the value that they enter is either null, 0 or lower than 0. The algorithm/remainder of the java method is also prevented from running if this is the case in order to prevent the app form crashing from performing an invalid calculation such as division by 0.

A rectangle around the results textviews is also demonstrated in this app which makes the results section look more presentable.

The app must be named Car Buying Calculations in order to work. The rectangle.xml file must be in the drawable folder which can be done by right clicking on drawable (under res/resources) selecting New -> Drawable Resource File.
